# Top-Deck


The Top Deck application is a full-stack application that adhers to a MVC file structure with a full CRUD model. 
The current application allows users to build their own Pokemon decks from a database of Pokemon cards.
This includes cards from the base deck through Sword and Shield. They can update the name of their deck as well as as delete cards from their deck. 

The application is deployed through Heroku and can be accessed here: https://topdeck-frontend.herokuapp.com/

Forthcoming Features:
Additional styling using React Bootstrap |
Sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
